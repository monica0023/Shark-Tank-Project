The following engineered features were extracted from each audio clip:

**Feature	Description	Insight**

🗣️ speech_rate	Words spoken per second	Lower rates may suggest slowed cognitive processing

😶 hesitation_count	Number of filler words like “uh”, “um”	High hesitations may signal recall or fluency issues

🎵 pitch_mean	Average voice pitch	Monotone or extreme pitch could be markers

🎶 pitch_std	Pitch variation	Reduced variation suggests flat affect or reduced expressiveness

📊 word_count	Total words spoken	May help identify brevity or lack of elaboration

"""3.ML Methodology Used

**Step	Description**

🔍 Model	IsolationForest (Unsupervised)

✅ Why?	It detects anomalies without labeled data, ideal for early-stage screening

🔢 Output	Each sample was classified as either “Normal” or “At Risk”

🎨 Interpretability	Simple enough for visualization and clinical explanation (used scatter plot for insights)

Isolation Forest is preferred here for its interpretable nature and effectiveness on high-dimensional small datasets.

4. Risk Detection Summary

The model identified samples with high hesitation, low pitch variation, or low speech rate as "At Risk", which aligns with known early markers of cognitive decline (like Alzheimer’s, MCI).

"""5.Next Steps to Improve Clinical Relevance

**Area	Recommendation**

📈 More features	Add pause duration, syllable count, speech energy, word-substitution errors, etc.

📋 Labeled Data	Collaborate with neuroclinicians to get real patient data with cognitive scores

🤖 ML Upgrade	Try Autoencoders or Explainable Clustering (e.g., SHAP with DBSCAN)

🧠 Clinical Tests	Integrate verbal fluency/naming tasks (e.g., “Name 3 fruits…”) and track response delays

🌍 Multi-lingual Models	Use WhisperX with language detection to support global deployment

📊 Dashboard	Build a clinician-friendly UI with charts, warnings, and audio playback

✅ Conclusion

This prototype lays the foundation for a lightweight, explainable speech-screening tool. With richer features and clinical input, it could evolve into a non-invasive early warning system for cognitive impairment.
